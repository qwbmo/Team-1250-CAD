This document details the Team 1250 CAD naming comventions for components and files.

# Team Components

Custom components created by the team should follow the pattern:

`FRC1250-<YY>-<SUBSYSTEM>-<####> <SOMETHING-DESCRIPTIVE>`
...where:
- `<YY>` is the last two didgits of the competition year (example: 2026 -> `26`)
- `<SUBSYSTEM>` is the code name for the subsystem:
  - `DRIVE`
  - `ARM`
  - `SHOOTER`
  - `INTAKE`
  - `CLIMB`
  - etc...
- `<###>` a unique, mostly sequential 4-digit number for the specific parts in the subsystem
- `<SOMETHING-DESCRIPTIVE>` some text that describes the part, because the numbers can be hard to remember

Why go to all of this trouble?
- The year field allows us to track parts over time.
- The subsystem field helps everyone understand the basic context.
- The number field makes it unique.
- The something descriptive field makes it friendly for humans.

A note on where parts should live:
- Parts require `CAM` (computer aided manufacturing) tool paths that live within the Fusion files.  These can pose processing challenges when part of a large assebly. Therefore, parts that will me CNC machined should always be external linked parts, not local parts within an assembly.
- 3D printed parts are easy to export, so they may be kept local (probably easiest) or may be external.
- Parts made by people require a drawing to be created, but do not pose processing issues, so they may be kept local (probably easiest) or may be external.
